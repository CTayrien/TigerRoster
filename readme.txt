TigerRoster: Free Open-Source app to help take attendance, record who has completed in-class exercises or homework, or just to help identify students and learn their names and faces

Directions:

In the current version of the software, the user must make the database. Fixing this problem permanently requires adding code to interface with the SIS website or its server/database, and I don't even know what language to begin using on my end, or what interface (if any) is exposed to me on their end.

For now, each user must create the database.
1) Create a folder named Roster next to the executable.
2) Create 4 folders in Roster\. These are your 4 classes. When running the program, the 4 buttons get their labels (names) from these folders' names.
3) Go to SIS and download all of your students portraits. Name each one "Firstname Lastname.png". In the app, the portraits will get their labels from the names of these files. Put students from each class into the appropriate folder.

When running the program, press a button with one of your classes names on it - the students faces and names appear! Press a student's face-button and it will disappear.

Other stretch goals (missing buttons and functionality) include "reset" or "clear", "export" (mycourses or xls format), and "import" (from sis).

Also note: student names are currently difficult to read - should be labels above or below the face.

Final thoughts: students would appreciate the ability to edit their picture and names in the database. Being able to send an email from the program, and also the ability to aggregate student scores would be beneficial.
